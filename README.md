# TheCFDMan

This repository contains lecture notes, literature recommendations,  tutorials, code, and examples for performing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using mainly open-source software such as OpenFOAM, SU2, and PyFR. The aim is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers and engineers who are interested in using CFD to solve fluid mechanics problems.

The repository includes scripts and configuration files for different types of simulations, such as laminar and turbulent flows, heat transfer, and multiphase flows. Additionally, it includes documentation on the theory and numerical methods used in CFD, as well as tutorials for beginners to get started with the software tools.

**Note:**

*   Degree of Freedom/Limitation: Refers to the maximum number of degrees of freedom or any other usage limitations that apply to the free to use option of the commercial software.
*   Node limit: Refers to the maximum number of computational nodes that the software can utilize for parallel computing.
*   Physics: Refers to the types of fluid mechanics problems the software can simulate (e.g. general CFD, multiphase flows, heat transfer, etc.).
*   Interface: Refers to the type of user interface provided by the software (e.g. graphical user interface, command line interface).

Keep in mind that this table only provides a brief overview of the different CFD software available and there may be other factors to consider when choosing a software tool for your specific needs.
