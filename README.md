# TheCFDMan
This repository contains lecture notes, literature recommendations,  tutorials, code, and examples for performing CFD simulations using mainly open-source software such as OpenFOAM, SU2, &amp; PyFR. The aim is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers and engineers who are interested in using CFD to solve fluid mechanics problems.
